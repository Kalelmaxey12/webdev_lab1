      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Kalel Maxey, and I’m a student-athlete at the Illinois Institute of Technology. I play basketball for my school, and it’s a huge part of my life. Ever since I was a kid, basketball has been my passion. I love the competition, the teamwork, and the focus it takes to get better every single day.</p>

      <p>I’m 6'7" tall and known for being athletic and hardworking. My goal is to make it to the NBA one day. I know that it takes discipline, sacrifice, and determination to reach that level, but I’m committed to giving it my all. My experience as a college athlete has helped me build confidence, responsibility, and leadership skills that go beyond the court.</p>

      <h2>My Basketball Journey</h2>
      <p>I started playing basketball when I was young, and over time it became something that shaped my identity. At Illinois Tech, I’ve learned how to manage both academics and athletics. Balancing late-night practices, early-morning workouts, and classes can be tough, but it has taught me time management and mental strength.</p>

      <p>Even when things get hard, I remind myself why I started playing: for the love of the game and the challenge of becoming the best version of myself. Basketball has introduced me to great teammates, mentors, and opportunities to grow as a person.</p>
